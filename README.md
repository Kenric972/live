# A desktop application built with JavaFX that combines a media player, video downloader, and integrated web browser.
The app demonstrates hands-on experience in multithreading, media playback, UI design, and external process integration.

Features

Media Playback – Play, pause, seek, and control volume for videos.

Video Downloader – Download videos from supported sites with resolution selection, progress tracking, and cancellation support.

File Metadata Management – Automatically extracts and displays file size, video duration, and generates thumbnails.

Embedded Web Browser – Browse and search videos directly in-app using JavaFX WebView.

Responsive UI – Buttons, sliders, and settings panel for a professional user experience.

Multithreading – Downloads and video playback run in the background to keep the UI smooth.

External Process Integration – Uses yt-dlp for video streaming and downloads.

Technologies Used

Languages & Tools: Java 17+, Git

Frameworks & Libraries: JavaFX (MediaPlayer, WebView, FXML), Scene Builder, yt-dlp

Concepts: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), multithreading, file handling, process management, UI/UX design

What I Learned

Built a complex desktop application using JavaFX and FXML.

Applied multithreading to keep downloads and media playback non-blocking.

Integrated external tools (yt-dlp) from Java for streaming and downloads.

Managed file metadata, thumbnails, and file size calculations programmatically.

Created a responsive and interactive UI with sliders, buttons, and a settings panel.

Worked with MediaPlayer APIs for video playback, events, and duration tracking.
